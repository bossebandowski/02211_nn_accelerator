This directory contains just a collection of useful,
but private scripts. It shall not be considered as part
of the official Patmos distribution. Every developer may
add some convenient scripts here. There shall be no
dependency of the Patmos design flow on the scripts here.

Martin: I will use this to easy my split development
environment (OS X and Windoz in a VMWare).
